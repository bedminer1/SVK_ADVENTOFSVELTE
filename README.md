# About
My attempt at Advent of Svelte 2023 https://advent.sveltesociety.dev/. 

One of the most fun and productive challenges I've undertaken in dev(maybe even more than The Odin Project).

Another piece of advice for newcomers is to look around for inspiration after your first attempt and to go back to work on a v2. That helped me learn a lot of cool new tricks.

On top of base challenges, added random challenges I received from friends in the (bonus) file

# Tech I Learnt
- Threlte: 3D modelling and rendering
- Chartjs: when you need charts
- SkeletonUI: nice out-of-the-box styles and features like paginators
- superforms + zod: makes working with forms featureful and simple

TODO: 
- add links to learning resources and inspirations
- talk about patterns used and my approach to each day
